# LHDNS — Ledger-based Hashed Decentralized Naming System

**Short:** A privacy-first, ledger-backed ephemeral naming/resolution layer.

## About
LHDNS replaces traditional DNS lookups with short-lived, hash-based ledger entries to improve privacy, resist censorship, and provide verifiable resolution.

**Key ideas:** hashed identifiers, rotating nonces, ephemeral ledger entries, off-ledger secure transport.
