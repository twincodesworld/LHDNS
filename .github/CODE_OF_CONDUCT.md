# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of the **LHDNS (Ledger-based Hashed Decentralized Naming System)** project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
### Positive behavior includes:
- Demonstrating empathy, patience, and respect toward others  
- Valuing differing opinions and constructive discussion  
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing when necessary  
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over personal gain  

### Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Use of sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances  
- Trolling, insulting, or discriminatory comments  
- Public or private harassment or intimidation  
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit consent  
- Any conduct inappropriate for a professional and collaborative setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards and may take fair corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — online and offline — and when individuals officially represent the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be sent to:

**Project Maintainer:** Ahmad Hemmati  
**Email:** contact@twincodesworld.com

All complaints will be handled promptly, fairly, and confidentially.
