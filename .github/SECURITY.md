## Reporting a Vulnerability (Responsible Disclosure)

If you discover a security vulnerability in **LHDNS**, **please do NOT open a public issue**. Public disclosure may put users at risk.

Instead, report the issue privately to:

- **Email:** contact@twincodesworld.com  
- **Subject line:** `LHDNS Security Disclosure`

**When reporting, please include:**
- Short summary of the issue and potential impact.
- Reproduction steps or a minimal proof-of-concept (if safe).
- Affected component(s) and version (e.g., Annex A, client SDK, node).
- Any suggested mitigations or patches (optional).
- Your preferred contact method and timeline for disclosure coordination.

We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and coordinate a timeline for a fix and disclosure.

## Vulnerability Handling & Timeline

1. **Acknowledgement:** within 72 hours after receipt.
2. **Triage & Assessment:** security team evaluates impact and prioritizes fix.
3. **Mitigation & Patch:** a fix is developed, tested, and staged.
4. **Coordinated Disclosure:** details are published only after a fix is available and deployed (or an agreed disclosure date with the reporter).

If immediate mitigation is needed (e.g., active exploitation), the team may publish a temporary advisory with mitigation steps prior to full patching.

---

## Emergency Contact (alternate)
If email fails or you need an alternate secure channel, indicate so in your initial message and we will provide a secure upload link or PGP key (on request).

---

## Public Security Advisories
When a vulnerability is fixed and coordinated disclosure is complete, a public advisory may be published in the repository `SECURITY_ADVISORIES` folder or release notes, with attribution only if the reporter consents.

## Thank you
